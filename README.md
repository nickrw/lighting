workspace.qxw
=============

My generic QLC+ workspace, party mode :)


Kam-Laserscan-Hyper-3D-1500.qxf
===============================

A fixture definition for a KAM Laserscan Hyper 3D, operating in grating
and patterns mode. Channel one controls the mode, and the definitions
for channels 2-19 only make sense when channel 1 is in range 245-255.
